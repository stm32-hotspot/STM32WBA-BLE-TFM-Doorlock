## <b>Mechanical </b>

This folder contains the necessary files (doorlock.stp) requiered to 3D print the physical doorlock if the physical part of the demo is wanted.

The 3D print is divided in two parts:
- The top of the doorlock
- the body of the doorlock

Once all the parts have been printed, the top and the body can be attached with a hinge.
Two slots facing each others are located on the body and on the top. These slots are made to insert neodymium magnet. 
These magnet can be held in place by inserting a screw in the slot or with using glue.

Inside the body, a insert has been made to fix the electromagnet with screw. For the electromagnet to hold the door shut, it is necessary to put a ferromagnetic ring on the door, facing the electromagnet.

The two two magnet will repel each others while the electromagnet will hold the door by attracting the ring. When the electromagnet will be released, the magnet will automatically help the door to open.

The NUCLEO-WBA52CG can be attached on the front of the body by using, dual side adhesive tape.
